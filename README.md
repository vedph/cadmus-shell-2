# Cadmus Shell

This is the second iteration of [Cadmus](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus) frontend refactoring.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4, and upgraded since then up to version 14. For version 15, which implies dropping a number of obsolete libraries, the repository has been cloned into this one. Development will continue on this repository, while others are kept for backwards compatibility only. Historical versions are listed here:

1. [original shell app](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_shell): this was a draft.
2. [version 1](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-shell): this is a production version. It was upgraded up to Angular 14.
3. version 2 is this version. It is still the same repository, with a few core changes:

- [Akita](https://github.com/salesforce/akita) has been replaced by [ELF](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/). This implies changing the store model behind each editor and list. New documentation will follow on this. This change was required by Akita obsolescence. Further, ELF has the advantage of being more modern and framework-independent.
- the dirty change mechanism has been refactored and now uses [this solution](https://github.com/vedph/ngx-dirty-check).
- Angular Material has been upgraded to 15, which implies a number of style adjustments.
- `@angular/flex-layout`, which has been obsoleted, has been removed and replaced by pure CSS with some media queries where required.

üí° For **pre-Angular-15** projects, see the [migration instructions](migration.md).

üêã Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update version in `env.js` (and Docker files), and then `ng build --configuration=production`;
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:4.1.0 -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:latest` (replace with the current version).

## History

- 2023-06-16: updated Angular.
- 2023-05-26:
  - fix default facet in new item.
  - removed stale code from events.
  - refactored event editor for related entities.
- 2023-05-25: fix validation in triple editor (conditional validator did not work because control value was not up to date when evaluating).

### 6.0.0

- 2023-05-22: breaking changes for parts using the new [asserted composite ID](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell/blob/master/projects/myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-ids/README.md#asserted-composite-id):
  - refactored _pin links part_ and _pin links fragment_ (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`: bump version to 6.0.0): links are now of type `AssertedCompositeId` (from bricks).
  - refactored related entity ID for _historical events part_: ID now is an `AssertedCompositeId` rather than a string.
  - refactored comments for _comments part and fragment_: `externalIds` (an array of items of type `AssertedId`) now is `links`, an array of items of type `AssertedCompositeId`.

### 5.0.0

- 2023-05-19:
  - preserve content for graph page in `CadmusGraphPgEx`.
  - added move to source capability to `CadmusGraphPgEx`.
- 2023-05-16: updated source type filters in graph UI (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`).
- 2023-05-11: updated to Angular 16.
- 2023-04-28: added `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` to comment, names, and note parts.
- 2023-04-21: added `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` to the historical events part, thus enabling it to have role-dependent thesauri like the categories part.

### 4.1.0

- 2023-03-11:
  - moved imaging parts (gallery image annotations part) out of general parts into its own library, removing unnecessary packages from this demo.
  - better UI layout in categories and index keywords.
- 2023-03-07: updated packages.

### 4.0.12

- 2023-03-02:
  - added gallery image annotations part, using the [image gallery bricks](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell/blob/master/projects/myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery/README.md). In the demo shell I added new modules (`CadmusImgAnnotatorModule`, `CadmusImgGalleryModule`) and an `img_anno_eid` index lookup definition to let users play with references to image annotations via EID. Also, the gallery requires additional injection providers in `app.module`, and the following libraries:
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-img-annotator` (brick)
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery` (brick)
    - `@recogito/annotorious` which also requires adding CSS to `angular.json`.
  - updated Angular.
- 2023-02-27:
  - added `tag` to historical event.
  - added feature: role ID suffix for thesauri (in `edit-part-feature-base.ts`): this is a new opt-in mechanism by which a part can request its thesauri IDs to be suffixed by its role ID (preceded by underscore). The categories part now opts into this new mechanism, so that you can have multiple categories parts each with its own, distinct set of categories. To opt in, just add `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` in your feature component constructor: the part will then request suffixed thesauri. For instance, the categories part, which requests a `categories` thesaurus, when having a role equal to `eras` will rather request a `categories_eras` thesaurus to the server. Still, the returned set key will not change: its name will still be `categories`, so that the part code is not broken, but in fact the content of the thesaurus was got from `categories_eras` (which is still the ID of the thesaurus keyed under `categories`). If some of the requested thesauri need not to change, just add an alias thesaurus with the role suffix, pointing to the original thesaurus.
- 2023-02-26: multiple chronotopes in historical event (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`).
- 2023-02-24: added pin links fragment layer (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` and (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`)).
- 2023-02-22:
  - updated Angular.
  - fix to event editor: relation reset when picking lookup item (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`).
- 2023-02-17:
  - edited node as a bindable property in graph node list (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`).
  - refactored API graph service (`@myrmidon/cadmus-api`).
  - replaced graph lookup component with the generic lookup brick (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`; added `GraphNodeLookupService`).
- 2023-02-15: added optional `tag` to pin links part entries (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` and `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`).

### 4.0.11

  - cut tail `.-` in filtering related event thesauri.

### 4.0.10

- 2023-02-06: changes to binding in bibliography-entry; chronotopes-part; comment-editor; doc-references-part; external-ids-part; historical-date-part; historical-event-editor; index-keyword; tiled-data; quotation-entry. These reflect the new bricks (mostly assertions or chronotopes), whose binding has been fixed so that now the initial-property hack is no more required.

### 4.0.0

- 2022-11-30:
  - **breaking change**: renamed thesaurus `categories` as `comment-categories` for comment part/fragment. This allows using different categories for comments and categories parts. Should you need to use the same categories, just create a thesaurus alias.
  - removed `@angular/flex-layout` from `@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-editor`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-list`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-search`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-list`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-ui`, tiled text layer part and token text layer part.

The following history refers to version 1.

### 3.1.5

- 2022-11-03:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - fixes to events editor.
  - hierarchical thesauri for events and relations in events editor. When specified, selecting an event type triggers filtering of relations according to the selected ID prefix. This is equal to the ID of the selected entry up to the last dot, i.e. from event type `person.crm:E67_birth` we filter all the relation entries starting with `person.`. This allows different granularity levels in filtering: for instance, should we have `person.birth.crm:E67_birth` (prefix `person.birth.`), we could have two relation entries `person.birth.P96_by_mother` and `person.birth.P97_from_father`, which are available only when a person's birth event is selected (rather than just a person's event). If no thesauri are specified, you can just fill the IDs without constraints.

### 3.1.4

- 2022-10-25:
  - in `@myrmidon/cadmus-core` fix to `textLayerService.selHasAnySpan`: check for SPAN element did not stop when adding a new selection and another selection in the context of the same ancestor is found after the insertion point.

  - updated Angular.
  - added styles for apparatus preview.
- 2022-09-14: updated Angular.

### 3.1.1

- 2022-08-21: added matching mode to flags in items filter, API service, and core models. Now items can be filtered by flags not only by looking at all the flags set, but also to any flag set, all flags clear, and any flags clear. Affected libraries:
  - cadmus-core
  - cadmus-api
  - cadmus-state
  - cadmus-item-list
  - cadmus-item-editor
- 2022-08-08:

  - added `cadmus-preview-ui` and `cadmus-preview-pg`.
- 2022-08-07: updated Angular.
- 2022-08-05: thesauri names for proper names/chronotopes.

### 3.1.0

- 2022-05-31: updated API version in Docker scripts.

- 2022-05-21:
  - upgraded Angular.
  - fixed historical events chronotope visualization in events list (`cadmus-part-general-ui`).

  - upgraded Angular to 13.3.5.
  - fixed item editor flags on logout/login.
  - fixed item search layout.
- 2022-03-19: removed moment and fixes to metadata part editor. Libraries affected: cadmus-item-editor, cadmus-item-list, cadmus-item-search, cadmus-part-general-ui, cadmus-ui.

### 2.0.1

- 2022-03-10: upgraded Angular to 13.2.6.
- added in `tsconfig.json` `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` in order to work around [this issue](https://github.com/urish/ngx-moment/issues/275) in `ngx-moment`.

### 2.0.0

- 2022-03-01: upgraded Angular to 13.2.4.
- 2022-02-13: `ModelEditorComponentBase`: internally access `model` via private member rather than property setter/getter. Using the setter would unnecessarily trigger `onModelSet`.
- 2022-01-31: removed `DocReference`, `PhysicalDimension` and `PhysicalSize` interfaces from models (these are now in bricks). Upgraded Angular to 13.2.0.
- 2022-01-16: added `ChronotopesPart` to `cadmus-part-general-ui` and `cadmus-part-general-pg`. Image: 2.0.1.
- 2022-01-04: added `MetadataPart` to `cadmus-part-general-ui` and `cadmus-part-general-pg`. Removed physical size from `cadmus-ui` (now moved to bricks), increasing `cadmus-ui` version to 2.0.0.
- 2021-12-20: upgraded Angular and fixed ID passed via `getItemLayerInfo` in state library.
- 2021-12-18: recreated an Angular 13.0.4 workspace and moved old shell libraries into it while refactoring:
  - auth-related libraries replaced with `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-login` and `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-admin`.
  - base model editor slightly refactored to use new services.
  - generic models and their editors replaced with bricks.
  - comment part and fragment now uses `ExternalId`'s for IDs rather than an array of strings. This is also reflected in the backend models (`Cadmus.Parts` from version 2.7.0, `Cadmus.Seed.Parts` from version 1.5.0).
  - Cadmus material removed, and replaced by more granular imports in each Material consumer.
