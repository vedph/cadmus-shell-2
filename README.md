This is the second iteration of Cadmus frontend refactoring.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4, and upgraded since then up to version 14. For version 15, which implies dropping a number of obsolete libraries, the repository has been cloned into this one. Once tested, development will continue on this repository, while others are kept for backwards compatibility only. Historical versions are listed here:

1. [original shell app](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_shell): this was a draft.
2. [version 1](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-shell): this is a production version. It was upgraded up to Angular 14.
3. version 2 is this version. It is still the same repository, with a few core changes:

- [Akita](https://github.com/salesforce/akita) has been replaced by [ELF](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/). This implies changing the store model behind each editor and list. New documentation will follow on this. This change was required by Akita obsolescence. Further, ELF has the advantage of being more modern and framework independent.
- the dirty change mechanism has been refactored and now uses [this solution](https://github.com/vedph/ngx-dirty-check).
- Angular Material has been upgraded to 15, which implies a number of style adjustments.
- `@angular/flex-layout`, which has been obsoleted, has been removed and replaced by pure CSS with some media queries where required.

ðŸ’¡ For pre-Angular-15 projects, see the [migration instructions](migration.md).

Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`.
2. update version in `env.js` and then `ng build`.
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:4.0.9 -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:latest` (replace with the current version).

## History

### 4.0.0

- 2022-11-30:

  - changed prefix building in historical event editor.
  - added lookup pipe to selected event type in historical event editor.

The following history refers to version 1.

### 3.1.5

- 2022-11-03:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - fixes to events editor.
  - hierarchical thesauri for events and relations in events editor. When specified, selecting an event type triggers filtering of relations according to the selected ID prefix. This is equal to the ID of the selected entry up to the last dot, i.e. from event type `person.crm:E67_birth` we filter all the relation entries starting with `person.`. This allows different granularity levels in filtering: for instance, should we have `person.birth.crm:E67_birth` (prefix `person.birth.`), we could have two relation entries `person.birth.P96_by_mother` and `person.birth.P97_from_father`, which are available only when a person's birth event is selected (rather than just a person's event). If no thesauri are specified, you can just fill the IDs without constraints.

### 3.1.4

- 2022-10-25:
  - in `@myrmidon/cadmus-core` fix to `textLayerService.selHasAnySpan`: check for SPAN element did not stop when adding a new selection and another selection in the context of the same ancestor is found after the insertion point.

- 2022-09-14: updated Angular.

### 3.1.1

- 2022-08-21: added matching mode to flags in items filter, API service, and core models. Now items can be filtered by flags not only by looking at all the flags set, but also to any flag set, all flags clear, and any flags clear. Affected libraries:
  - cadmus-core
  - cadmus-api
  - cadmus-state
  - cadmus-item-list
  - cadmus-item-editor
- 2022-08-08:

  - added `cadmus-preview-ui` and `cadmus-preview-pg`.

- 2022-03-01: upgraded Angular to 13.2.4.
- 2022-02-13: `ModelEditorComponentBase`: internally access `model` via private member rather than property setter/getter. Using the setter would unnecessarily trigger `onModelSet`.
- 2022-01-31: removed `DocReference`, `PhysicalDimension` and `PhysicalSize` interfaces from models (these are now in bricks). Upgraded Angular to 13.2.0.
- 2022-01-16: added `ChronotopesPart` to `cadmus-part-general-ui` and `cadmus-part-general-pg`. Image: 2.0.1.

- 2021-12-18: recreated an Angular 13.0.4 workspace and moved old shell libraries into it while refactoring:
  - auth-related libraries replaced with `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-login` and `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-admin`.
  - base model editor slightly refactored to use new services.
  - generic models and their editors replaced with bricks.
  - comment part and fragment now uses `ExternalId`'s for IDs rather than an array of strings. This is also reflected in the backend models (`Cadmus.Parts` from version 2.7.0, `Cadmus.Seed.Parts` from version 1.5.0).
  - Cadmus material removed, and replaced by more granular imports in each Material consumer.
